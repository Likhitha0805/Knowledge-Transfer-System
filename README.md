# Knowledge Transfer System (Java + MongoDB)

## Description

The **Knowledge Management System** is a Java-based application integrated with **MongoDB** to store, manage, and retrieve knowledge records efficiently. The project demonstrates how a Java application can interact with a NoSQL database using the MongoDB Java Driver and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

This project is ideal for academic mini-projects and for students learning Java backend development and NoSQL databases.
